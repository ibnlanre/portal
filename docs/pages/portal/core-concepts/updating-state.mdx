# Updating state

The state of a portal can be updated using the `setState` function returned by the `use` hook. It can also be updated using the `setItem` utility function, that is exported by the `portal` object. The following code snippet demonstrates how to update the state of a portal:

```typescript copy filename="update-state.tsx"
const [name, setName] = portal.use("client");
setName("Jane Doe");
```

## Using the `setState` function

It is advised that you do not use the `setState` function within the top level of a React Component. This is because the `setState` function would trigger a rerender of the component, which may lead to an infinite loop. Instead, use it within a `useEffect` hook.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to properly use the `setState` function:

```typescript copy filename="update-state-with-use-effect.tsx"
const [name, setName] = portal.use("client");

useEffect(() => {
  setName("Jane Doe");
}, []);
```

## Callbacks as arguments to `setState`

The `setState` function also accepts a callback as its argument. The callback accepts the current state as its argument and returns a value. The returned value becomes the new state of the portal. This is useful when the current state of the portal is required to update the state.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use a callback as an argument to `setState`:

```typescript copy filename="update-state-with-callback.tsx"
const [name, setName] = portal.use("client");

useEffect(() => {
  setName((prev) => prev.toUpperCase());
}, []);
```
