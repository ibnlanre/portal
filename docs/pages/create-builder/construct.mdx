# `createBuilder`

The `createBuilder` function is used to create a builder object for defining keys and values. It accepts a register as its first argument, and an optional list of prefixes as its second argument. The register is thus used to create a builder with a tree-like structure, having the root as the starting point.

## Importing the module

`createBuilder` is exported as a named export from the `@ibnlanre/portal` package. The following code snippet demonstrates how to import the `createBuilder` function:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder } from '@ibnlanre/portal';
```

## Creating a builder

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `createBuilder` function:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder } from '@ibnlanre/portal';

const register = {
  foo: {
    baz: (id: number) => `/bazaar/${id}`,
    bar: 10,
  },
};

const no_prefix_builder = createBuilder(register);
```

## Builder with prefixes

If the builder had prefixes, the keys array would be prefixed with the prefixes, followed by the keys of the register. The prefixes can serve as an identifier for the builder. And although, there is no limit to the number of prefixes that can be used, it is advised to use a maximum of two prefixes. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `createBuilder` function with prefixes:

```typescript copy

const builder = createBuilder(register, ["root", "branch"]);
```
