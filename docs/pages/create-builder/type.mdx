# createBuilder type

To get the type of object passed to the builder, or the type of a nested property, use the `typeof` operator with the `.is` property of the builder. This is useful for type checking the object passed to the builder, or for type checking the return value of a nested property.

Although the actual value of `builder.is` is `undefined`, the type of `builder.is` is the type of the object passed to the builder. To get the value, you can use either the `use` or `get` method.

```typescript
const builder = createBuilder({
  name: 'John',
  age: 42,
  getHeight: () => Math.random() + 150,
});

// Note that the actual value of builder.is is undefined.
type StoreType = typeof builder.is;
//   ^? { name: string; age: number; }

// Ease of use accessing the type of nested properties.
type NameType = typeof builder.is.name;
//   ^? string
```
