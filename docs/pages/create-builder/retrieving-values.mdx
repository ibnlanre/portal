# Retrieving values

The root is the starting point of the `builder` object. It is effectively the register, which is passed to the `createBuilder` function. Calling the `.use` function on the root branch returns the register itself, while calling the `.get` function constructs a key for the root. This is a different behavior from the other branches, which instead, generates a key from the nested keys of the register. The following code snippet demonstrates what the root branch looks like:

```typescript copy
builder.use(); // register
builder.get(); // ["root", "branch"]
```

## Nested values

As a consequence of the `use` function returning the register, it is possible to retrieve the nested values of the register. The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the nested values of the register:

```typescript copy
builder.use().foo.baz(12); // "/bazaar/12"
builder.use().foo.bar; // 10
```

## External libraries

The `builder` object is useful for generating keys for asynchronous state management libraries, such as [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) and SWR ([Stale-While-Revalidate](https://swr.vercel.app/)). This eliminates the need to manually construct keys for each query, and reduces the risk of inconsistencies and conflicts.

The values of the nested keys in the `builder` object can be made function queries, making it a documentation for the various endpoints to the API. This approach simplifies code maintenance, dynamic key generation, and refactoring, as the `builder` object becomes the single source of truth for all queries.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to define an **endpoint** builder using `createBuilder`:

```typescript copy
const endpoint = createBuilder({
  users: {
    list: () => axios.get<{
      data: {
        id: number;
        name: string;
      }[];
    }>("/users"),
    delete: async (params: { id: number }) => {
      return axios<{ message: string; }>({
        url: `/users/${params.id}`,
        method: "DELETE",
      })
    }
  },
});
```

- Generating the query key using the `use` function:

```typescript copy
const { data: users } = useQuery({
  queryKey: endpoint.users.list.use(), // ["users", "list"]
  queryFn: () => endpoint.use().users.list()
});
```

- Generating the query key using the `get` function:

```typescript copy
const { mutate } = useMutation({
  mutationKey: endpoint.users.delete.get(5), // ["users", "delete", 5]
  mutationFn: () => endpoint.use().users.delete({ id: 5 })
});
```

In the example above, the `endpoint` object is used to generate keys for the `useQuery` function. The `endpoint` object is also used to retrieve the query function, which is passed to the `queryFn` property of the `useQuery` function.
