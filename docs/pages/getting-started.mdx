# Getting Started with Portal

This is the official documentation for `portal`, a simple **application** state management library for managing [React](https://reactjs.org/) state across multiple components. `Portal` is designed to be **simple**, yet **intuitive**, and was inspired by [React Holmes](https://github.com/devx-os/react-holmes) and [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).

`Portal` creates a global state that can be accessed by any component in your application. It is lightweight, and has no dependencies. It is also framework agnostic, so it can be used with any React framework. `Portal` is also written in TypeScript and ships with its own type definitions.
