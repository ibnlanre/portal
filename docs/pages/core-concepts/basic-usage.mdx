# Basic Usage

While `portal` itself is an object containing a couple of utility functions, creating states requires the `use` hook. The `use` hook accepts a key and an optional configuration object as its arguments.

<Callout type="info">Because `use` is a hook, it should be called from within a React component or another hook.</Callout>

The configuration object defines the initial state of the portal, and how the state is treated. If a configuration object is not passed to the `portal` function, the initial state is set to `undefined`. The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a `portal` without a configuration object:

```typescript copy filename="portal-without-configuration.tsx"
const [name, setName] = portal.use("client")
```

## Configuration object

The configuration object can have the following properties:

### `state`

The `state` property is used to define the initial state of the portal. It has the same signature as the argument passed to a `useState` hook. Unless the `state` property is defined, the type of the state is inferred as `undefined`. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `state` property:

```typescript copy filename="portal-with-state.tsx"
const [name, setName] = portal.use("client", {
  state: "John Doe"
});
```

The `state` property can also be a function that returns the initial state. The function should, however, not have any side effects. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `state` property:

```typescript copy filename="portal-with-state-function.tsx"
const [name, setName] = portal.use("client", {
  state: () => "Jane Doe"
});
```

### `get`

The `get` property can be used to retrieve the initial state from a persistent storage. The `get` function accepts the current state as an argument and sets the returned value as the next state of the portal. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `get` property:

```typescript copy filename="portal-with-get.tsx"
const [name, setName] = portal.use("client", {
  get: (state) => {
    const value = localStorage.getItem("client");
    if (value) return JSON.parse(value) as string
    return state;
  }
});
```

### `set`

The `set` property is a side effect that can be used to update the browser store when the state changes. It is also called when the portal is instantiated. The `set` function accepts the current state as an argument. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `set` property:

```typescript copy filename="portal-with-set.tsx"
const [name, setName] = portal.use("client", {
  set: (state) => {
    const value = JSON.stringify(state);
    localStorage.setItem("client", value);
  }
});
```

### `select`

The `select` property is used to transform the current state into a different value. The `select` function accepts the current state as an argument and returns a value. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `select` property:

```typescript copy filename="portal-with-select.tsx"
const [name, setName] = portal.use("client", {
  select: (state) => state.toUpperCase()
});
```

## Combining properties

The `state`, `get`, and `set` properties can be used together to define the initial state, how the initial state is retrieved, and how the state is persisted. If the `state` property is not defined, a good practice is to define the `get` function before the `set` function, because of type inference. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `state`, `get`, and `set` properties:

```typescript copy filename="portal-with-state-get-set.tsx"
import { get, set } from 'idb-keyval';

const [name, setName] = portal.use("client", {
  state: "John Doe",
  get: async (state) => {
    const value = await get('client');
    if (value) return JSON.parse(value);
    return state;
  },
  set: async (state) => {
    const value = JSON.stringify(state);
    await set('client', value);
  }
});
```
