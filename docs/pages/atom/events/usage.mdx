# Using the `events` property

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `events` property:

- The state of the atom is retrieved from `localStorage`. This does not cause hydration problems because the state is calculated at the point of creating the atom. The returned value is set as the initial state of the atom.
- The `set` event is triggered when the state of the atom is updated. It is used to persist the state of the atom in `localStorage`. The returned value is set as the new state of the atom.
- The `get` event is triggered when the state of the atom is accessed, within a React Component. It is used to convert the state of the atom to a string. This conversion does not affect the state of the atom.
- The `use` event is triggered when the atom is used within a React Component. It is called only once, when the component mounts. It is used to increment the state of the atom every second. It returns a function that is used to clear the interval, which would be called when the component unmounts.

```typescript copy
const counterAtom = atom({
  state: () => {
    const value = localStorage.getItem("counter");
    if (value) return JSON.parse(value);
    return 0;
  },
  events: {
    set: ({ value }) => {
      localStorage.setItem("counter", JSON.stringify(value));
      return value;
    },
    get: ({ value }) => value.toString(),
    use: ({ set }) => {
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        set((prev) => prev + 1);
      }, 1000);

      return () => clearInterval(interval);
    },
  },
});
```
