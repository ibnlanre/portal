# `.get`

The `get` event is triggered when the state of the atom is accessed, within a React Component. This event can be used to modify the state of the atom before it is retrieved. The `get` function accepts a `params` object as its first argument and an arbitrary number of arguments as its second. The `params` object includes the following properties:

- `value`: The state about to be retrieved.
- `previous`: The current state of the atom.
- `ctx`: The context of the atom.
- `emit`: A function used to update the context of the atom.

## Using the `get` event

The arbitrary number of arguments are expected to be passed on the `use` hook, via its `getArgs` property. These arguments can be seen as dependencies of the `get` event. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `get` event, with dependencies:

```typescript copy
const counterAtom = atom({
  state: 10,
  events: {
    get: ({ value }, increment: number, decrement: number) => {
      return value + increment - decrement
    },
  },
});
```

### Using the `getArgs` property

In the above example, the `get` event is used to modify the state of the atom, before it is retrieved. The `get` event is passed two dependencies, `increment` and `decrement`, which are used to modify the state of the atom. 

The `get` event is triggered when the state of the atom is retrieved, modifying the state of the atom before it is returned. Using the `getArgs` property of the `use` hook, we can pass the dependencies of the `get` event. 

The `getArgs` property accepts an array of arguments, which are passed to the `get` event. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `getArgs` property:

```typescript copy
const [counter, setCounter] = counterAtom.use({
//       ^? 18
  getArgs: [10, 2]
});
```
