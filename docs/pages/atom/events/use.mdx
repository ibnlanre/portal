# `.use`

The `use` event is a wrapper around the `useEffect` hook. It is suitable for executing side effects, such as network requests, and WebSocket connections. The `use` event accepts the properties returned by the `atom` function as its first argument, and an arbitrary number of arguments as its second. 

## Parameters

The object of parameters includes the following properties:

### State properties

- `value`: The current state of the atom.
- `subscribe`: A function used to subscribe to the state of the atom.
- `publish`: A function used to update the state of the atom without triggering the `set` event.
- `timeline`: An object that provides methods to navigate previous states of the atom.
- `set`: A function used to update the state of the atom.

### Context propeties

- `ctx`: The context of the atom.
- `provide`: A function used to subscribe to the context of the atom.
- `emit`: A function used to update the context of the atom.

### Garbage collection

- `on`: An object containing functions for managing garbage collection.
- `dispose`: A function used to trigger garbage collection.

## Using the `use` event

The `use` event is triggered as a result of an atom being used in a React Component. It is invoked when the component mounts, and when the arbitrary number of arguments passed on the `use` hook changes. This matters only if the `use` event has an arbitrary number of arguments. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `use` event:

```typescript copy
const contactsAtom = atom({
  state: ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"],
  events: {
    set: ({ value }) => decrypt(value),
    get: ({ value }) => {
      return value.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));
    },
    use: ({ set }, search: string = "") => {
      const abortController = new AbortController();

      const url = new URL("http://example.com/contact");
      if (search) url.searchParams.set("filter", search);
      else url.searchParams.delete("filter");

      fetch(url.toString(), {
        signal: abortController.signal,
      })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then((value) => {
          set(value.data);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.error('Error:', error.message);
        });

      return () => {
        abortController.abort();
      }
    },
  },
});
```

### Using the `useArgs` property

The arbitrary number of arguments are expected to be passed on the `use` hook, via its `useArgs` property. These arguments can be seen as dependencies of the `use` event. If the `enabled` property of the `use` hook is set to `false`, the `use` event will not triggered. It is however `true` by default. 

The `useArgs` property is useful when the `use` event depends on the state of the component. It accepts an array of arguments, which are passed on the `use` hook. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `use` hook, with the `useArgs` property:

```tsx copy
const [search, setSearch] = useState("");
const [data, setData] = contactsAtom.use({ useArgs: [search] });

return (
  <input onChange={(event) => setSearch(event.target.value)} />
);
```

## Disposing the garbage

Garbage collection is a mechanism for reclaiming memory that is no longer being used by an application. It is important to dispose the garbage, in order to prevent memory leaks. The `use` event provides two ways of disposing the garbage: using the `dispose` function, or using the `dispose` object. Additionally, the `on` object can be used to manage garbage collection.

### Using the `dispose` function

The `use` event returns a function that can be used for cleanup, in order words, dispose the garbage. The function is called only when the component `unmounts`. The following code snippet shows what that function looks like:

```typescript copy
return () => {
  abortController.abort();
}
```

### Using the `dispose` object

An object containing functions for managing garbage collection, during `rerun` and `unmount` could also be returned, instead. This may be convenient when cleanups are required both during `rerun` and `unmount`. The following code shows what the object looks like:

```typescript copy
return {
  rerun: () => {
    abortController.abort();
  },
  unmount: () => {
    abortController.abort();
  },
}
```

### Using the `on` object

A final alternative would be to use the `on` object, which is made available within the `use` event. Consequently, it can be used within callbacks, and the `use` event itself. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `on` object:

```typescript copy
on.rerun(() => {
  abortController.abort();
});

on.unmount(() => {
  abortController.abort();
});
```
