# `atom`

atom is a standalone state container that can be accessed and modified from anywhere in your application. It uses the same underlying mechanism as the `portal` function for reactivity, but is designed to replicate the behavior of the `useEffect` hook outside of React Components. 

## Importing the module

The `atom` function is a named export of the `@ibnlanre/portal` library. It can be imported as shown below:

```typescript copy
import { atom } from '@ibnlanre/portal';
```

## Configuration object

`atom` accepts a configuration object as its argument. The configuration object can have the following properties:

### `state`

The initial state of the atom. It can be a primitive value, an object, or an array. In order words, it can be any value.
  
- **Required**: `true`
- **Type**: `any`

### `events`

An object containing functions that can be used to update the state of the atom. The functions are called events because they are triggered when the state of the atom changes.

- **Required**: `false`
- **Type**: `object`
- **Default**: `{}`
- **Properties**:
  - `use`: A function that is called when the state of the atom changes.
  - `set`: A function that is called when the state of the atom is set.
  - `get`: A function that is called when the state of the atom is accessed.

### `context`

An object containing states that do not influence the state of the atom. The states are called context because they are made available during instantiation and usage.

- **Required**: `false`
- **Type**: `object`
- **Default**: `{}`

### `debug`

A boolean value that determines if the atom should log its state to the console.

- **Required**: `false`
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Default**: `false`

### `debounce`

A set of options that determines the how the `use` event is triggered.

- **Required**: `false`
- **Type**: `object`
- **Default**: `{}`
- **Properties**:
  - `delay`: The number of milliseconds to wait before triggering the `use` event.
  - `leading`: A boolean value that determines if the `use` event should be triggered immediately.
  - `trailing`: A boolean value that determines if the `use` event should be triggered after the `wait` period.
