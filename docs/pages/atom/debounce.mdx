title: atom - debounce property
description: Learn how to use the debouce property of an atom.

---

The `debounce` property of an atom allows you to debounce the `use` event of an atom. This is useful when you want to delay the execution of the `use` event until a certain amount of time has elapsed since the last time the `use` event was triggered.

The property is an object with the following properties:

- `delay`: The number of milliseconds to wait before triggering the `use` event.

  - **Required**: `false`
  - **Type**: `number`
  - **Default**: `0`

---

- `leading`: A boolean value that determines if the `use` event should be triggered before the `delay` elapses.

  - **Required**: `false`
  - **Type**: `boolean`
  - **Default**: `false`

---

- `trailing`: A boolean value that determines if the `use` event should be triggered after the `delay` elapses.

  - **Required**: `false`
  - **Type**: `boolean`
  - **Default**: `true`
